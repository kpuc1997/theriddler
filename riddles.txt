Who is the man in the portrait? Why?I am an eye as clear as can be,

I received a riddle at work and I cannot for the life of me figure it out. 

Here is is: get to the number 49 by using the following numbers: 100, 23, 56, 40, and 6. All numbers must be used. 

I made a list of all 120 permutations of those 5 numbers and input them into a program that checked possible operator combinations and received no answers. It’s possible there may have been a bug in that process, but I suspect it’s trickier than just +, -, x, /
